# A-COMPARATIVE-STUDY-OF-WOMEN-IN-FILMMAKING

This repository contains the code for my final year Honours project, titled 'A Comparative Study of Women in Filmmaking: Hollywood vs Bollywood'. In this project, the representation of women filmmakers in Hollywood and Bollywood and its impact on movie success was investigated using machine learning techniques.

For this project, the data was collected from the following sources:

The code is divided into two Jupyter notebooks:

DATA PRE-PROCESSING AND GENDER PREDICTION: An exploratory data analysis and visualization was performed on the data. The data was then pre-processed and feature extraction was performed. Gender prediction was performed for names with missing genders using SVM classifier models and n-gram suffixes of names.
INVESTIGATION OF FEMALE REPRESENTATION OFFSCREEN: Using Random Forest Regressor models and Generalized Linear Regression models with L1 penalty, the representation of female filmmakers in Hollywood and Bollywwod and its impact on the succes and popularity of movies was investigated.
